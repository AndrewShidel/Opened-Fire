					Earth has been taken over and infested entirely by zombies. You have been sent to the desolate planet to end the infestation that could potentially spread throughout the universe. 
					In your current state the zombies will not come out from hiding so you dress as a human, spray some brain scented body spray on and before you know it you're ready to deploy to earth and 
					begin your mission. The only problem is the earths atmosphere degrades your armor so you need to act fast collecting dropped gears to replenish your health and expand your armory.
